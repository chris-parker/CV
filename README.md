## Chris Parker

A keen and logical puzzle-solver with a lifelong commitment to learning, from coding languages to spoken languages to ridiculous amounts of pub quiz trivia. Going from never having written a line of code in my life to working on complex group projects in a span of 12 weeks demonstrates my passion for knowledge and my ability to thrive under intense pressure. Having just completed one huge challenge I'm now looking to be a join a team who will keep challenging me day in and day out.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

- Having worked in several different teams during my time at Makers Academy I've shown myself to be extremely adaptable to the needs of the other members, able to give both positive and negative feedback and to help solve all kinds of problems. Every team I've worked with has been much more than just the sum of its parts and this has helped us to achieve results which would have been impossible for any one member. I've also demonstrated the ability to fill different roles in a team in my previous career working for Domino's Pizza: starting as a driver and ending as a Store Manager I gained an excellent understanding of how a team should work together to achieve excellence.

#### Attention to detail

- A missing accent on a French word or a wrong note in a piece of music can change its meaning entirely. I've spent a large proportion of my life learning to avoid mistakes like these and I'm now able to use this ability to quickly spot a typo or a missing bracket in the middle of a line of code and avoid the need for painful debugging sessions.

#### Mental agility

- I'm able to complete crosswords, sudoku and all manner of other puzzles with an extremely high level of speed and accuracy. I'm a strong chess, Scrabble and poker player and have become highly competent at many other complex board games, often within the first couple of plays.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (February-May 2016)

- Being at Makers Academy allowed me to learn more than I ever thought possible in such a short timeframe and has really shown me how much potential I have. The experience has really awakened my passion for code and my desire to learn and grow as a newly-formed developer. At Makers I learned to write clean and SOLID code with a strong emphasis on AGILE and TDD, working in languages such as Ruby and Javascript, frameworks such as Rails, Angular.js and Ionic, and testing suites such as Rspec, Karma and Protractor.

#### University of Exeter (September 2004-June 2006)

- I studied French with Italian for two years before deciding I preferred a much different learning experience. I completed modules of study in both languages, as well as in linguistics, culture and history. While at Exeter I was a valuable member of both the university Symphony and Chamber Orchestras, as well as being on the University Challenge team for the 2006 series in which we made the quarter-finals.

#### Musical qualifications

- Grade 8 violin (pass, 2003)
- Grade 8 viola (merit, 2004)
